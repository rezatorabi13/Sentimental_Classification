### Sentiment classification task for hotel reviews
Sentiment Analysis is the most prominent branch of natural language processing. It deals with the text classiÔ¨Åcation in order to determine the intention of the author of the text. Here, I used data for hotel reviews with rating from 1 to 5. There are 3 sets of data (train, dev, and test). Using train and dev data, we train the model to predict the rating for test data (which has no rating).

### Methods
We use two methods in here:
    1- Naive-Bayes model
    2- LinearSVC model
In Naive-Bayes and LinearSVC models, first we train the model using the default parameters. After that, we tune the hyperparameters to improve the accuracy. Finally, a GrideSearch is used to find the best parametes.
    

### Result
The best accuracy was obtained for LinearSVC model (after tunning the hyperparameters) which is **%76.4**.

the predicted ratings for test data can be found in "prediction.xlsx" file.
